Hello,

We use this demo assignment for submission testing and autograding testing.

1. You will have your own assignment repo automatically created by Github. Commit/push to this repo is equvalent to submission.

2. You submission will be autograded in this demo assignment. Take a look at the autograding test results. You can have as many pushes as you want.

Have fun :)
